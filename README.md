# About

Setup of Rancher v1.1.3 based off of Rancher-Ansible by github user [galal-hussein](https://github.com/galal-hussein/Rancher-Ansible).
We will wrap this Ansible provisioner inside a Vagrant environment.

# Future addons to the Provisioner

We will continue to use and keep the Rancher-Ansible provisioner up to date on a separate fork maintained [here](https://github.com/codesheppard/Rancher-Ansible). 

# TODOS:

Keep this up to date with all versions of Rancher.
Upgrade this to V1.2
